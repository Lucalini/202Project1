Part 1 Goal: Write a Python program to generate all the permutations of the characters in a string. 


Part 2: create a recursive function named convert() that will take a non-negative
integer num (base 10) and a base b (integer from 2 to 16) and return a string representing the base b number



Part 3: This question involves a game with teddy bears. The game starts when I give you some bears. You can then
repeatedly give back some bears, but you must follow these rules (where n is the number of bears that you
currently have):
1. If n is even, then you may give back n//2 bears.
2. If n is divisible by 3 or 4, then you may multiply the last two digits of n and give back this many bears.
3. If n is divisible by 5, then you may give back 42 bears.
The goal of the game is to end up with EXACTLY 42 bears.
